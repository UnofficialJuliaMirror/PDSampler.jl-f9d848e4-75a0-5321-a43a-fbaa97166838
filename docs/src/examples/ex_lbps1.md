# Local BPS (Chain of Gaussians)

(*the code for this example can be found [here](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/PDMP.jl/blob/master/test/ex_lbps1.jl), note that the doc rendered here was automatically generated, if you want to fix it, please do it in the julia code directly*)

The approach to using the local BPS is much the same as for the global oneexcept that you need to specify a `FactorGraph`.That object will contain the structure of the factor graph (i.e.: which factor is connected to which variables) as well as the list of all factors (which have a `lgradll` and `nextevent` since each factor can be seen individually as a small BPS).Below, we show how to declare a chain of bivariate gaussians:```julia
using PDMPnfac = 3 # number of factorsmvg = MvGaussianStandard(zeros(2),eye(2))# all factors have that same likelihoodchainfactor(i) = Factor(                    (x,v)->nextevent_bps(mvg, x, v),                    (x)->gradloglik(mvg, x),                    i )# assemble into a chain graphchain = chaingraph([chainfactor(i) for i in 1:nfac])```
This is a simple graph with a known structure so that it's already definedthrough the `chaingraph` function (in `src/local/factorgraph.jl`). For anarbitrary graph, you would need to provide two things:1. the structure of the factor graph: a list of list where each element corresponds to a factor and the corresponding list contains the indices of the variables attached to that factor2. the list of factorsThe rest is very similar to the global BPS:```julia
srand(123)lambdaref  = .01maxnevents = 10000T          = Infnvars      = chain.structure.nvarsx0         = randn(nvars)v0         = randn(nvars)v0        /= norm(v0)lsim = LocalSimulation(chain, x0, v0, T, maxnevents, lambdaref)(all_evlist, details) = simulate(lsim)```
The `all_evlist` object contains a list of `EventList` corresponding to whathappened on each of the factors. It can also be sampled using `samplelocalpath`(cf. `src/local/event.jl`).
